### :large_orange_diamond: About
This repo contains all (working and tested) dotfiles for my Linux setups.
My setup uses Xorg so note that if you're using Wayland.  
The files in the root of this repo should correspond to your home folder.  
For example, the `.bash` directory should correspond to `~/.bash` in your machine.

### :large_orange_diamond: Programs to install 

* ranger

Then do:

```
ranger --copy-config=all
```

* fzf

### :large_orange_diamond: Managing the dotfiles

It's recommended to manage them with the `stow` package. `stow` manages and creates symlinks. By using `stow` you won't have to copy your local dotfiles to your git repository every time you want to make changes. To install `stow`:

| Arch                  | Ubuntu                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| `sudo pacman -S stow` | `sudo apt-get install stow` |


`stow`'s workflow is:
1. Clone your dotfiles in some location (to a workspace)
2. Use stow to create symlinks from your workspace (e.g. `~/Documents`) to `~`
3. When you edit your dotfiles in the workspace, those in `~` will be symlinked to your workspace therefore automatically updated.
4. When you're done with editing the files in the workspace and you've tested them, you're ready to commit on git!
```
cd ~/Documents
git clone git@github.com:leonmavr/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
# or:
# https://github.com/leonmavr/dotfiles.git
```
Suppose we want to manage the `.bash` folder. Then:
```
rm -rf ~/.bash
mkdir ~/.bash
stow --target=/home/$USER/.bash .bash
```
Verify that symlinks were created:
```
cd ~/.bash
ls -l
```
Output:
```
bash_aliases -> ../Documents/dotfiles/.bash/bash_aliases
...
```

### :large_orange_diamond: Managing the branches
* This is the master branch and its contents should be minimum. Master contains only files that can be used independtly of OS and desktop environment, e.g. bash and vim configs.
* Other branches include standalone dotfiles for specific operating systems, mainly for Arch.
* It's there recommended to merge the master into the other branches every once in a while.
